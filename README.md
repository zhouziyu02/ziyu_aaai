This is the official implementation of our AAAI 2026 submission titled **"KFNet: Efficient Pre-aligned Irregular Time Series Forecasting through Spatial Correlation and Temporal Compression"**

## ðŸ”§ Reproducing Experiments

Under the path ./KFNet/KFNet, reviewers can reproduce experiment on Human Activity dataset by simply running:


```bash
bash ./test.sh
```

## ðŸ“‚ Model Implementation

The core model implementation can be found in the file:

```
./model/KFNet.py
```
